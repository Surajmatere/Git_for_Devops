this is my first file i want pull this file from my local machine.


now i want to push this file from the local machine to github

currently i have used how push the data by using the ssh first i have created the ssh-keygen (private and public key)
then going the github in the github go to the setting and ssh -> new ssh key -> come to repo and copy ssh key
-> then check the current remote -v -> then chnage the remote url -> cmd = git remote set-url (past copied ssh url)
